Project Overview
This project focuses on risk management in cryptocurrency portfolios by employing Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and unsupervised machine learning techniques. 
It aims to assess the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies, evaluate transaction and control risks, and improve portfolio risk-adjusted returns 
using advanced clustering and optimization techniques.

Problem Statement
Cryptocurrency markets present high risks, including money laundering, unauthorized access, and transactional anonymity issues. 
Traditional control mechanisms in financial institutions are challenged by these unique risks,
which this project aims to address using HRP and ML techniques.

Existing System Analysis
Research and methods like multi-asset allocation, variance frameworks, and wavelet-based analysis have been used for cryptocurrency portfolio management. 
However, these approaches have their limitations regarding transaction controls, misrepresentation, and transaction delays.

Disadvantages of Existing Systems
Lack of control over transactions at exchanges
Risk of losing private keys
Unauthorized access leading to theft
Transaction anonymity issues in blockchain
Recording and representation difficulties for financial compliance

Proposed Solution
This project proposes a Hierarchical Risk Parity model integrated with machine learning techniques to:
Identify and manage intrinsic and control risks in cryptocurrency transactions
Provide a graph-based risk analysis approach using clustering, recursive bisection, and quasi-diagonalization techniques
Offer improved risk-adjusted returns with tailored risk management strategies

Project Features
Clustering Datasets: Uses data segmentation to evaluate risk groupings
Recursive Bisection: Provides effective risk partitioning
Quasi-Diagonalization: Optimizes risk evaluation and control

Benefits
Improved risk management through intrinsic and correlated risk evaluation
Enhanced compliance and control mechanisms for financial reporting
Real-time risk assessment and mitigation in cryptocurrency trading and holdings
